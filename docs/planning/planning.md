# Planning

## Overview

The **Port Management System project** is developed over the 5th semester (2nd year, 1st semester) of the Degree in
Informatics Engineering (LEI) at ISEP during the 2025-2026 academic year.
It follows a **Project-Based Learning (PBL)** approach using **Scrum methodology**, integrating five course units (UCs):

* **ARQSI** (Arquitetura de Sistemas),
* **LAPR5** (Laboratory and Project V),
* **SGRAI** (Sistemas Gráficos e Interação),
* **GESTA** (Gestão),
* **ASIST** (Administração de Sistemas).
* **IARTI** (Inteligência Artificial).

The project is divided into **three sprints**, each with specific deadlines and UC participation, culminating in a fully
functional system by **January 2026**.

## Team Composition

* **Team Size**: 5 students
  The team consists of students identified in the following table:

| Student Number | Name                 |
|----------------|----------------------|
| **1230564**    | Francisco dos Santos |
| **1230839**    | Emanuel Almeida      |
| **1231274**    | Jorge Ubaldo         |
| **1230444**    | Romeu Xu             |
| **1211225**    | Alexandre Moura      |

* **Roles**:

    * **Scrum Master**: LAPR5 PL teacher (weekly meetings during LAPR5 PL+OT class).
    * **Development Team**: 4 students responsible for analysis, design, implementation, testing, and documentation.

* **Formation**: Teams are finalized within the first two weeks of the semester (by mid-September 2025) and validated by
  the LAPR5 PL teacher via Moodle submission.

## Task Distribution

Throughout the project development period, the distribution of *tasks / requirements / features* by the team members
will be tracked in GitHub Issues and documented in the following way:

## Scrum Process

### 1. Weekly Meetings

Weekly meetings are held during LAPR5 PL+OT classes, led by the Scrum Master:

* Review task progress vs. sprint goals.
* Plan upcoming tasks and solve blockers.
* Adjust sprint backlog as needed.
* Follow an **adapted Daily Scrum** to ensure communication and transparency.

### 2. User Stories

Each sprint starts with **User Stories**:

1. Reception & analysis (requirements, dependencies, ACs).
2. Clarification of doubts via **LAPR5 RUC**.
3. Planning & assignment of stories to tasks.
4. Implementation & validation with acceptance criteria.

### 3. Task Division & Responsibilities

* Balanced workload — no member is overloaded.
* Rotation for learning — members work in different areas.
* Integration across UCs — each student contributes to multiple courses.

### 4. Evidence & Tracking

* Frequent commits on GitHub with descriptive messages.
* Issues used to track work and link to project board.
* Pull Requests reviewed before merge.
* Documentation updated in `docs/` with technical decisions and architecture.

## Technical Documentation

* **Location**: `docs/` folder in GitHub.
* **Content**: sprint plans, retrospectives, UML (use case, class, sequence) diagrams in SVG via PlantUML, DDD diagrams,
  design docs.
* **Tools**: PlantUML, GitHub Actions for CI/CD.

## Risk Management

* **Conflicts**: Resolved internally; escalated to LAPR5 PL teacher if needed.
* **Technical Issues**: Mitigated via CI/CD, test-driven development, nightly builds.
* **Scalability**: Addressed by ensuring the system can handle growth in number of vessels, docks, storage areas, and
  notifications.
* **Integration Risks**: Minimized by defining clear bounded contexts (DDD) and consistent APIs.
